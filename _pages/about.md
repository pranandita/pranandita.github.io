I am an economist and social scientist passionate about shaping data-driven public policy in developing countries. My current research seeks to identify the root cause of inflation during the Sri Lankan financial crisis of 2022. For this, I use time-series econometrics to understand the role of macroeconomic variables, particularly money supply and exchange rates.

In future research, I want to bridge my knowledge of macro and monetary economics with microeconomics for designing climate change-resilient policies for poverty and inequality reduction in South Asian countries. Methodologically, I am keen to expand my data science skills in econometrics to include SQL, big data tools, and machine-learning models.
