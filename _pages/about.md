I am an economist and social scientist passionate about shaping effective public policy in developing countries through data science. My current research on monetary policy seeks to identify the root cause of high inflation during the Sri Lankan financial crisis of 2022. For this, I use time-series econometrics to understand the roles of macroeconomic variables, particularly money supply and exchange rates. 

In future research, I want to bridge my knowledge of macro and monetary economics with microeconomics to design climate change-resilient policy for poverty and inequality reduction in South Asian countries. Methodologically, I am looking to expand my data science skills in econometrics and R and Python by learning machine-learning modeling, SQL, and big data tools. 

Beyond my quantitative research, I am also studying the political ecology of wildlife conservation in India using qualitative methods such as archival research. My training is highly interdisciplinaryâ€”my previous education in physics gave me a strong quantitative grounding and a uniquely analytical perspective. I have also worked in a nonprofit in rural India in the past, and I continue to seek ways to work in the field, communicate research to lay audiences, and in other ways engage with communities beyond academia.
