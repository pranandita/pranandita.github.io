I am an economist and social scientist passionate about shaping data-driven public policy in developing countries. My current research seeks to identify the root cause of inflation during the Sri Lankan financial crisis of 2022. For this, I use time-series econometrics to understand the role of macroeconomic variables, particularly money supply and exchange rates. Apart from macroeconomics, I am interested in ecological economics and climate-change adaptation—particularly common-pool resource management problems, which I have explored through complex systems theory and agent-based models.

I start my PhD in economics in Fall 2025, where I plan to focus on macroeconomics and climate-change adaptation in developing countries. Methodologically, I am keen to expand my data science skills in econometrics to include SQL, big data tools, and machine-learning models as well as delve deeper into complexity economics.

Beyond quantitative research, I am studying the political ecology of wildlife conservation in India using qualitative methods, specifically archival research. My training is highly interdisciplinary—my previous education in physics gave me a uniquely analytical perspective on questions of social science. I have previously worked for a nonprofit in India and in academic publishing. I continue to seek ways to engage with communities beyond academia through fieldwork and science journalism.
