I am an economist and social scientist passionate about shaping data-driven public policy in developing countries. My current research seeks to identify the root cause of inflation during the Sri Lankan financial crisis of 2022. For this, I use time-series econometrics to understand the roles of macroeconomic variables, particularly money supply and exchange rates.

In future research, I want to bridge my knowledge of macro and monetary economics with microeconomics for designing climate change-resilient poverty-reduction policy in South Asia. Methodologically, I am keen to expand my data science skills in econometrics to include SQL, big data tools, and machine-learning models. 

Beyond quantitative research, I am studying the political ecology of wildlife conservation in India using qualitative methods, specifically archival research. My training is highly interdisciplinaryâ€”my previous education in physics gave me a uniquely analytical perspective. I have also worked in a nonprofit in rural India, and I continue to seek ways engage with communities beyond academia through fieldwork and science communication.
