I am an economist and social scientist passionate about shaping effective public policy in developing countries through in-depth data analysis. My current research focuses on identifying the root cause of inflation in Sri Lanka during the financial crisis of 2022 and implications for monetary policy. For this, I use time-series econometrics to understand the roles of macroeconomic variables, particularly money supply and exchange rates, in driving inflation. 

In future research, I want to bridge my knowledge of macro and monetary economics with microeconomics to design climate change-resilient policy for poverty and inequality reduction in South Asian countries. Methodologically, I am looking to expand my data science skills in econometrics and R and Python by learning machine-learning modeling, SQL, and big data tools. 

I believe that good science requires a plurality of methodologies, and I have complemented my quant skills with qualitative research. One of my current projects studies land conflicts over wildlife conservation in India using archival research. My training is highly interdisciplinaryâ€”my previous education is in physics gave me a strong quantitative grounding and a uniquely analytical perspective. 

I have also worked with an educational NGO in rural India, and the lessons I learned there are as valuable as any technical skills. I continue to seek ways to work in the field, communicate research to lay audiences, and in other ways engage with communities beyond academia.
