I am an economist and social scientist passionate about shaping effective public policy in developing countries through in-depth data analysis. I hold a joint master degree in economic policy from Sorbonne Université and the Vienna University of Economics and Business, among others, funded by an Erasmus Mundus scholarship. My master thesis focused on identifying the root cause of inflation in Sri Lanka during the financial crisis of 2022 and implications for monetary policy. For this, I used time-series econometric tools to understand the roles of macroeconomic variables, particularly money supply and exchange rates, in driving inflation. 

In future research, I want to bridge my knowledge of macro and monetary economics with microeconomics to design climate change-resilient policy for poverty and inequality reduction in South Asian countries. Methodologically, I am fascinated by data science and how data can answer questions about society. I am looking to expand my skills in econometrics and the programming languages R and Python by learning advanced machine-learning modeling, SQL and database manipulation, and big data tools. 

I believe that good science requires a plurality of methodological approaches; I have complemented my quant skills with qualitative research. One of my current research projects studies land conflicts over wildlife conservation in India from a political ecology perspective using archival research. My training is also highly interdisciplinary—my previous education is in physics with a specialization in semiconductor technology. This gave me not only a strong quantitative grounding but also a uniquely analytical perspective on economics and social science. 

In the past, my desire to go outside the confines of elite universities led me to work with an educational NGO in rural areas of India, and the lessons I learned there are as valuable as any technical skills. I continue to seek ways to work in the field, communicate research to lay audiences, and in other ways engage beyond the academic community.
