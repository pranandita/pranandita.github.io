I am an economist and social scientist passionate about shaping effective public policy in developing countries through in-depth data analysis. My current research focuses on identifying the root cause of inflation in Sri Lanka during the financial crisis of 2022 and implications for monetary policy. For this, I used time-series econometrics to understand the roles of macroeconomic variables, particularly money supply and exchange rates, in driving inflation. 

In future research, I want to bridge my knowledge of macro and monetary economics with microeconomics to design climate change-resilient policy for poverty and inequality reduction in South Asian countries. Methodologically, I am looking to expand my data science skills in econometrics and R and Python by learning machine-learning modeling, SQL, and big data tools. 

As I believe that good science requires a plurality of methodologies, I have sought to complement my quant skills with qualitative research. One of my current projects studies land conflicts over wildlife conservation in India a political ecology perspective using archival research. My training is highly interdisciplinaryâ€”my previous education is in physics gave me not only a strong quantitative grounding but also a uniquely analytical perspective on economics. 

In the past, my desire to go outside the confines of elite universities led me to work with an educational NGO in rural areas of India, and the lessons I learned there are as valuable as any technical skills. I continue to seek ways to work in the field, communicate research to lay audiences, and in other ways engage beyond the academic community.
