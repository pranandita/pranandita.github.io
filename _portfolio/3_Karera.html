title: "Conservation why? A political ecology investigation of wildlife laws in India"
excerpt: "In 2022, a three decade-old bird sanctuary in central India was de-notified by the national government as the project had failed—all the birds were dead, and local communities were unhappy at losing land rights when the sanctuary was declared. Such conflict over land is a common theme across conservation projects in independent India, and their root can be traced to the ideological stance that conservation requires exclusion of humans, with the marginalized being the easiest to exclude. This project aims to understand the ideological basis of Indian conservation laws, particularly the Wild Life (Protection) Act of 1972, and their implications for policy and social justice. Ultimately, it asks the question, do we need to rethink why we conserve nature? "

<p>In 2022, the three decade-old Great Indian Bustard Sanctuary in Karera in central India was de-notified by the government following years of protests from local residents who lost their land rights when the sanctuary was declared. Karera is not an isolated case; since colonial times and before, India has a history of undermining the rights of marginalized communities in the name of protecting nature. The need to exclude humans to protect nature stems from a philosophy of human–nature dualism, which persists to this day in the legal and bureaucratic system. In the 1970s, a global frenzy around wildlife conservation coincided with the extreme authoritarianism of Prime Minister Indira Gandhi's second term in government, leading to the passing of the Indian Wild Life Protection Act (IWLPA) in 1972. In its very narrow vision on conservation, the IWLPA in its original form contained little acknowledgement of community rights. The IWLPA enabled repressive conservation policies that had disastrous consequences for humans and wildlife, of which Karera is just one example. </p>

<p>This ongoing project analyzes the case study of Karera in light of the political ecology of the Indian context from the 1970s to the present day using qualitative methods such as archival research, secondary research, and original interviews. A major aim of this research is to disseminate the findings to a general readership, not just an academic audience, through popular publications to stimulate democratic debate on the question, do we need to rethink why we do conservation policy?</p>

<p>This research was the basis of an academic paper, which can be found <a href="\files\Biswas_Karera_PolEcology.pdf">here</a>. This paper specifically addressed the issue of perceptions of science and its objectiveness in the conservation policy in the context of the case study of Karera.</p>
