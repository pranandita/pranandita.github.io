title: "Why conserve nature? A political ecology investigation of wildlife laws in India"
excerpt: "In 2022, a three decade-old bird sanctuary in central India was de-notified by the national government as the project had failedâ€”all the birds were dead, and local communities were unhappy at losing land rights when the sanctuary was declared. Such conflict over land is a common theme across conservation projects in independent India, and their root can be traced to the ideological stance that conservation requires exclusion of humans, with the marginalized being the easiest to exclude. This project aims to understand the ideological basis of Indian conservation laws, particularly the Wild Life (Protection) Act of 1972, and their implications for policy and social justice. Ultimately, it asks the question, do we need to rethink why we conserve nature? "
