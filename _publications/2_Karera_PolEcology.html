<p>Since colonial times, the forests of South Asia have been battlegrounds between different ideologies and ideas of how natural resources should be managed. Today, the bureaucrats of independent India largely retain the former colonial government's view that the conservation and human use of natural resources are mutually exclusive, with exclusionary conservation policy often being justified by a narrow  and ironically unscientific view of conservation 'science', which is understood as being universal, objective, and natural. This human--nature dualism undermines the needs and rights of local communities that are affected by these policies, leading to conflicts with governments. Using the case study of the failed bustard sanctuary in Karera in central India, this study analyzes the relationship between history, politics, and conservation science and its implications for policy and social justice based on archival research. Based on archival research, the study highlights the role of ideology in wildlife legislation and proposes a rethink of the ideological foundations and normative ends of conservation policy in India. </p>
